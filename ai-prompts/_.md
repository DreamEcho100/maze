Nice, now rewrite **FULLY** the README.md and update what's outdated or missing, and don't shy from making it length as long it's concise and cover the whole logic of the schemas, I want it to be precise, simple, detailed, as much as possible for any new newcomer or onboarding here

Notes:
- Mentioning parts is good, but not not much, only the needed parts to avoid headaches when refactoring the code.
- Again especially for things like query patterns, functions and utilities examples, again to avoid headaches when refactoring the code, don't write ACTUAL CODE, use sudo code if needed, or give a concise explanation or both

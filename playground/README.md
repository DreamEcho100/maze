# Playground

This projects here on this dir _`playground`_ are not real project, in a sense they're just test and play with new technologies, libraries, tutorials, courses, etc. Even though they could be referencing internal shared packages on this monorepo, they're not maintained or will be checked for updates _(mostly)_ or in CI/CD pipelines, etc. They're just for fun and learning purposes.

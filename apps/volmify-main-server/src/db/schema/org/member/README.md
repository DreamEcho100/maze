# **üè¢ Organization Member & Employee Management System**

This README explains the comprehensive organization member and employee management system architecture and implementation guide for the Volmify creator economy platform.

## **üéØ System Overview**

The member and employee management system provides a sophisticated organizational structure supporting:
- **Member lifecycle management** (invitation ‚Üí active ‚Üí suspended/left) for customers/learners
- **Employee management system** (invitation ‚Üí approval ‚Üí hiring ‚Üí active) for staff/creators  
- **Professional attribution** through job profile integration for cross-organizational reputation
- **CTI financial transaction access** with O(log n) indexed performance for marketplace-scale operations
- **Hierarchical departments** with nested structures and budget authority for professional organization
- **Flexible team collaboration** across departments for project-based work
- **Dual invitation workflows** with separate customer vs staff onboarding processes
- **Authority separation** between customer activities and administrative operations

## **üë• Core Entities & Their Purpose**

### **1. Organization Members (`orgMember`)**
**Purpose**: Customer/learner identity within an organization context

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-tenant user identity**: Same user can be member of multiple organizations
- **Customer role**: Primary focus on learning, purchasing, and community participation
- **Status lifecycle**: `invited` ‚Üí `active` ‚Üí `suspended`/`left`/`removed`
- **Display customization**: Custom display name per organization
- **Learning profile integration**: Connected to learning analytics and progress tracking
- **Financial context**: Access to customer purchase history via `accountTransactionMemberContext`
- **Gift card usage**: Members (including employees as customers) can use gift cards

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgMember: {
  id, userId, orgId, displayName, status, joinedAt, leftAt, 
  suspendedAt, suspendedReason, userProfileId
}
```

### **2. Organization Employees (`orgEmployee`)**
**Purpose**: Staff/creator identity with professional responsibilities and administrative authority

**Key Features**:
- **Professional upgrade**: Optional enhancement from member to employee status
- **Job profile integration**: Links to cross-organizational professional identity (`userJobProfile`)
- **Employment lifecycle**: `pending` ‚Üí `approved` ‚Üí `active` ‚Üí `terminated`
- **Revenue attribution**: Product creation and compensation tracking with post-platform-fee calculations
- **Administrative authority**: Tax management, gift card issuance, financial operations
- **Organizational duties**: Department/team assignments with budget authority inheritance
- **Compensation management**: Salary tracking separate from product attribution
- **CTI financial access**: Professional earnings via `accountTransactionEmployeeContext`

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgEmployee: {
  id, memberId, jobProfileId, role, professionalDisplayName,
  isSalaried, salary, hiredAt, terminatedAt, status
}
```

### **3. Member Invitations (`orgMemberInvitation`)**
**Purpose**: Customer/learner onboarding workflow

**Key Features**:
- **Email-based invitations** for customer access
- **Learning-focused**: Course access grants and learning community participation
- **Community integration**: Study groups, learning cohorts, forum access
- **Direct acceptance**: Simple workflow without complex approval requirements
- **Customer-specific permissions**: Focus on purchasing and learning activities

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgMemberInvitation: {
  id, orgId, email, displayName, invitedByEmployeeId,
  acceptedAt, declinedAt, status, invitationType
}
```

### **4. Employee Invitations (`orgEmployeeInvitation`)**
**Purpose**: Staff recruitment and professional onboarding workflow

**Key Features**:
- **Professional recruitment**: Staff roles with job profile context
- **Administrative approval workflow**: Review and approval required by existing employees
- **Employment details**: Proposed salary, start date, department assignment
- **Role specification**: Professional roles (instructor, admin, manager, creator)
- **Job profile linking**: Optional connection to professional identity for cross-organizational reputation
- **Admin approval tracking**: `approvedByEmployeeId` for compliance and audit trails

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgEmployeeInvitation: {
  id, orgId, email, role, proposedSalary, startDate, jobProfileId,
  invitedByEmployeeId, approvedByEmployeeId, acceptedAt, status
}
```

### **5. Departments (`orgDepartment`)**
**Purpose**: Professional organizational structure for employees with budget authority

**Key Features**:
- **Employee-focused**: Work organization and reporting structure
- **Nested hierarchy**: Parent-child department relationships with budget inheritance
- **Department types**: `department`, `division`, `business_unit`, `office`, `region`
- **Professional context**: Linked to job profiles and career development
- **Budget authority**: Financial responsibility with inheritance rules (child departments cannot exceed parent limits)

**Budget Authority Logic**:
```javascript
// Budget Inheritance Rules:
// - Child departments cannot exceed parent department budget limits
// - Employee spending authority inherits from primary department assignment
// - Cross-departmental teams use team lead's primary department budget authority
// - Budget validation enforced at transaction creation time
```

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgDepartment: {
  id, orgId, name, description, parentDepartmentId, departmentType,
  budgetAuthority, createdAt
}
```

### **6. Teams (`orgTeam`)**
**Purpose**: Employee collaboration units for project-based work

**Key Features**:
- **Cross-functional teams**: Employees from multiple departments
- **Project-based**: Temporary or permanent collaboration units
- **Team types**: `departmental`, `cross_functional`, `project`, `permanent`
- **Professional collaboration**: Work-focused team structure
- **Budget context**: Teams inherit budget authority from team lead's primary department

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgTeam: {
  id, orgId, name, description, type, leadEmployeeId,
  isActive, createdAt
}
```

### **7. Employee Department Memberships (`orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership`)**
**Purpose**: Employee assignment to departments with professional context

**Key Features**:
- **Professional assignment**: Work-based department structure
- **Job profile context**: Connected to professional identity
- **Career development**: Department-based professional growth
- **Budget authority inheritance**: Employee spending limits derived from department authority
- **Multiple assignments**: Employees can belong to multiple departments with primary designation

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership: {
  employeeId, departmentId, assignedAt, removedAt, 
  jobProfileContext, isPrimary
}
```

### **8. Employee Team Memberships (`orgEmployeeTeamMembership`)**
**Purpose**: Employee participation in teams with work roles

**Key Features**:
- **Team-scoped roles**: `admin` (team management) vs `member`
- **Professional collaboration**: Work-focused team participation
- **Project assignments**: Temporary or permanent team assignments
- **Cross-departmental coordination**: Teams can span multiple departments

**Schema Reference**:
```javascript
orgEmployeeTeamMembership: {
  employeeId, teamId, role, joinedAt, leftAt
}
```

## **üîÑ Architecture Separation: Members vs Employees**

### **Member Activities (Customer/Learner Focus)**
```javascript
// Customer/Learning Activities
orgMemberOrder                           // Purchase products/courses
orgMemberOrderItem                       // Individual order items
orgMemberProductCourseEnrollment        // Learn and take courses
orgMemberLearningProfile                // Learning analytics and progress
orgMemberGiftCardUsage                  // Gift card usage (any member including employees as customers)
orgMemberProductCourseChallengeRating   // Course feedback and ratings
orgMemberLearningGroup                  // Study groups and learning communities
orgMemberCohort                         // Learning cohorts and class sections

// CTI Financial Context
accountTransactionMemberContext         // Customer purchase and refund history (O(log n) indexed access)
```

### **Employee Activities (Professional/Work Focus)**
```javascript
// Professional/Work Activities
orgEmployeeProductAttribution           // Content creation and professional work
orgEmployeeProductAttributionRevenue    // Creator compensation and revenue sharing (post-platform fees)
orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership         // Professional organizational structure with budget authority
orgEmployeeTeamMembership               // Work-based team collaboration
orgEmployeeInvitation                   // Staff recruitment and onboarding (approval-based)

// Administrative Authority Activities
orgTaxRateSnapshot.byEmployeeId         // Tax rate management (employee authority)
orgGiftCard.issuedByEmployeeId          // Gift card issuance (employee authority)
account.managedByEmployeeId             // Chart of accounts management (employee authority)
orgProductApproval.reviewedByEmployeeId // Content approval workflows (employee authority)

// CTI Financial Context
accountTransactionEmployeeContext       // Professional earnings and attribution (O(log n) indexed access)
```

### **User Identity Architecture**
```javascript
// Clear Identity Separation:
user ‚Üí userProfile (main customer identity)
user ‚Üí userProfile (job) ‚Üí userJobProfile (professional extension of userProfile)

// Organizational Context:
orgMember.userProfileId ‚Üí userProfile (main)     // Customer context
orgEmployee.jobProfileId ‚Üí userJobProfile        // Professional context (extends userProfile)

// API-Level Enforcement:
// userJobProfile validation ensures it extends from userProfile of same user
// This maintains referential integrity while enabling professional context
```

### **Authority & Permission Logic**
```javascript
// Authority Levels:
Member = Customer (places orders, learns, participates, uses gift cards)
Employee = Staff (administrative authority + customer capabilities)

// Administrative vs Customer Activities:
// ‚úÖ Employees can: issue gift cards, manage taxes, approve content, post transactions
// ‚úÖ Members can: use gift cards, place orders, enroll in courses, participate in communities
// ‚úÖ Employees as customers: maintain member privileges for customer activities (dual role)

// Gift Card Logic:
orgGiftCard.issuedByEmployeeId          // Only employees can ISSUE gift cards
orgMemberGiftCardUsage.memberId         // Any member can USE gift cards (including employees)
```

### **Revenue Attribution Logic**
```javascript
// Post-Platform Fee Attribution:
Customer Payment: $100
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform Fee (5%): $5
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Processing Fee (3%): $3  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tax Withholding (jurisdiction-dependent): $8
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Net Revenue for Attribution: $84

// Employee Attribution on Net Amount:
orgEmployeeProductAttribution: { revenueSharePercentage: 70 } // 70% of $84 = $58.80
orgProductRevenuePool: { totalAllocationPercentage: 100 }     // 100% of $84 allocated

// Cross-Product Attribution:
// Each product maintains independent attribution (no cross-product limits)
// Same employee can have different attribution percentages across products
// Attribution based on effort/contribution per product, not total workload
```

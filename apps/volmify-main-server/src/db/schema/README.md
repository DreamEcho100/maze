# **üìö Volmify Database Schema Overview**

## **üéì What Volmify Is**

### **Primary Purpose**
Volmify is a comprehensive **creator economy platform** that combines learning management, e-commerce, and professional marketplace capabilities. It enables organizations to create, sell, and manage educational content while providing sophisticated employee management and revenue attribution systems.

### **Core Capabilities**
- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Course creation, enrollment, progress tracking
- **E-commerce Platform**: Product sales, subscriptions, gift cards, payment processing  
- **Creator Economy**: Revenue attribution, professional profiles, compensation management
- **Employee Management**: Staff onboarding, department organization, approval workflows
- **Professional Marketplace**: Cross-organizational job profiles, skill attribution, reputation systems
- **Advanced Financial System**: Double-entry accounting with multi-context CTI access for marketplace-scale performance

## **üèó Core Architecture Principles**

### **Multi-Tenant Foundation**
Every entity in Volmify is scoped to an organization (`orgId`), ensuring complete data isolation and supporting multiple independent tenants on the same platform.

### **User Identity Hierarchy**
```
User (platform identity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userProfile (main) - base customer profile  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userProfile (job) - professional profiles extending main profile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userLocale - language preferences with proficiency levels

orgMember (tenant-scoped customer/learner)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orgEmployee (enhanced staff role with optional job profile link)
```

### **Role Separation & Authority Levels**
- **Members**: Customers and learners who place orders, enroll in courses, participate in community
- **Employees**: Staff and creators who create content, receive revenue attribution, manage operations
- **Same user can be both**: Member (customer) AND employee (creator) within the same organization
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Employees have administrative authority over organizational operations, while maintaining member privileges for customer activities

### **Class Table Inheritance (CTI)**
Financial transactions use CTI for multi-context access, enabling O(log n) performance with indexed lookups for user transaction queries regardless of organizational complexity.

### **Multi-Context Access**
Single transactions are accessible through multiple entity contexts (user, employee, member, organization) with appropriate permission scoping and O(log n) indexed performance.

## **üë§ User Management System**

### **Platform Identity**
- **`user`**: Universal identity across the entire platform - cross-tenant, login-capable, globally unique
- **`userProfile`**: User's contextual profiles - one main profile (customer identity) and multiple job profiles (professional identities extending main profile)
- **`userJobProfile`**: Professional profiles that extend userProfile, work across organizations, enabling reputation and skill tracking

### **User Profile Architecture Logic**
```javascript
// Clear Identity Separation:
user ‚Üí userProfile (main customer identity)
user ‚Üí userProfile (job) ‚Üí userJobProfile (professional extension of userProfile)

// Organizational Context:
orgMember.userProfileId ‚Üí userProfile (main)     // Customer context
orgEmployee.jobProfileId ‚Üí userJobProfile        // Professional context (extends userProfile)

// API-Level Enforcement:
// userJobProfile validation ensures it extends from userProfile of same user
// This maintains referential integrity while enabling professional context
```

### **Localization & Preferences**
- **`userLocale`**: User language preferences with proficiency levels
- **`userLocaleProficiency`**: Skill levels (native, fluent, conversational, basic)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Platform-wide internationalization framework

### **Tenant-Scoped Identity**
- **`orgMember`**: User's presence within a specific organization as customer/learner

orgDepartment.parentDepartmentId    // Hierarchical structure

// Budget Inheritance Logic:
// - Child departments cannot exceed parent department budget limits
// - Employee spending authority inherits from primary department assignment
// - Cross-departmental teams use team lead's primary department budget authority
// - Budget validation enforced at transaction creation time
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Processing Fee (3%): $3  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tax Withholding (jurisdiction-dependent): $8
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Net Revenue for Attribution: $84

// Revenue Attribution on Net Amount:
orgEmployeeProductAttribution: { revenueSharePercentage: 70 } // 70% of $84 = $58.80
orgProductRevenuePool: { totalAllocationPercentage: 100 }     // 100% of $84 allocated

// Cross-Product Attribution Validation:
// Each product maintains independent attribution (no cross-product limits)
// Same employee can have different attribution percentages across products
// Attribution based on effort/contribution per product, not total workload
```

### **Financial System Scalability**
The CTI (Class Table Inheritance) transaction system enables:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Course B: 90% attribution of Course B net revenue  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Course C: 50% attribution of Course C net revenue

// Validation Rules:
// ‚úÖ Each product's attributions sum to 100%
// ‚úÖ Same employee can have different percentages across products
// ‚úÖ Attribution percentages based on contribution per product
// ‚úÖ Revenue calculation always on post-platform-fee amounts
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orgInvitationMemberContext       // Customer invitation context
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orgInvitationEmployeeContext     // Staff invitation context  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orgInvitationRequestContext      // Join request context (for private orgs)

// Benefits of CTI Approach:
// ‚úÖ Unified workflow for: invite, request-to-join, promote-member-to-employee
// ‚úÖ Consistent approval processes across invitation types
// ‚úÖ Private organization access control
// ‚úÖ Role transition management (member ‚Üí employee promotion)
```

### **Authority & Approval Logic**
```javascript
// Current Approval Hierarchy:
orgMemberInvitation                   // Direct acceptance (no approval needed)
orgEmployeeInvitation.approvedByEmployeeId // Employee approval required

// Business Rules:
// - Members can directly accept customer invitations
// - Employees require administrative approval from existing employees

accountTransactionContext ‚Üí Base context metadata
accountTransactionUserContext ‚Üí Cross-org user access (O(log n))
accountTransactionEmployeeContext ‚Üí Professional creator access (O(log n))
accountTransactionMemberContext ‚Üí Customer purchase access (O(log n))
accountTransactionOrgContext ‚Üí Administrative oversight access (O(log n))

// PERFORMANCE: O(log n) indexed user transaction queries vs complex polymorphic queries
// SCALABILITY: Supports marketplace-scale user activity across multiple organizations
```

#### **Organizational Structure Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Generic member structure
orgDepartmentMembership.memberId ‚Üí orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership.employeeId
orgTeamMembership.memberId ‚Üí orgEmployeeTeamMembership.employeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level professional structure with budget authority
// Departments and teams are work organization for staff with clear hierarchy
// Budget authority inheritance from department to employee level
```

#### **Administrative Operations Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Generic member operations
orgMemberInvitation.approvedByMemberId ‚Üí approvedByEmployeeId (but members self-approve)
orgProductRevenuePool.lastAllocationBy ‚Üí lastAllocationByEmployeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level administrative duties
// Only staff should manage revenue allocation and approve employee invitations
// Members handle customer invitations through direct acceptance
```

### **Implementation Priority**
1. **Revenue Attribution** (Critical) - Fix core business logic with post-fee calculation
2. **CTI Financial System** (Critical) - Enable marketplace-scale performance with indexed queries
3. **Financial Operations** (Critical) - Ensure compliance with proper authority separation
4. **Organizational Structure** (High) - Professional hierarchy with budget authority rules
5. **Administrative Operations** (Medium) - Staff workflow clarity with approval chains
6. **Invitation Systems** (Medium) - Proper onboarding separation (or future CTI unification)

## **üéØ Developer Quick Start**

### **Understanding the Updated Architecture**
1. **Member vs Employee Distinction**: Members are customers/learners, employees are staff/creators with administrative authority
2. **Professional Attribution**: Revenue flows to employees (with optional job profiles) based on post-platform-fee calculations
3. **CTI Financial System**: Multi-context access with O(log n) indexed performance for any entity type
4. **Authority Separation**: Clear separation between customer activities and administrative operations
5. **Budget Hierarchy**: Department-based budget authority with clear inheritance rules
6. **Gift Card Logic**: Employees can issue, members (including employees) can use
7. **Organizational Structure**: Departments/teams for employees with budget authority, learning groups for members

### **Key Development Patterns**
```javascript
// Customer Activities (Member-level)
orgMemberOrder ‚Üí Customer purchases (members including employees as customers)
orgMemberProductCourseEnrollment ‚Üí Learning participation
orgMemberLearningProfile ‚Üí Learning analytics
orgMemberGiftCardUsage ‚Üí Gift card usage (any member)
accountTransactionMemberContext ‚Üí Customer financial view (O(log n))

// Professional Activities (Employee-level)
orgEmployeeProductAttribution ‚Üí Content creation with post-fee revenue attribution
orgEmployeeProductAttributionRevenue ‚Üí Creator compensation (net of platform fees)
orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership ‚Üí Work organization with budget authority inheritance
orgEmployeeInvitation ‚Üí Staff recruitment (requires approval)
orgGiftCard.issuedByEmployeeId ‚Üí Administrative authority to issue gift cards
orgTaxRateSnapshot.byEmployeeId ‚Üí Administrative tax management
accountTransactionEmployeeContext ‚Üí Professional financial view (O(log n))

// Cross-Organizational User View
accountTransactionUserContext ‚Üí All transactions across organizations (O(log n) indexed)

// Financial Operations (CTI Multi-Context)
accountTransaction ‚Üí Double-entry transaction header
accountTransactionLine ‚Üí Accounting debits/credits
accountTransactionUserContext ‚Üí Cross-org user financial view
accountTransactionEmployeeContext ‚Üí Professional creator earnings (post-fees)
accountTransactionMemberContext ‚Üí Customer purchase history
accountTransactionOrgContext ‚Üí Administrative financial oversight

// Performance-Optimized Queries (O(log n) with proper indexing)
getUserTransactionsCTI(userId) ‚Üí Indexed lookup across all organizations
getEmployeeTransactionsCTI(employeeId) ‚Üí Direct professional earnings access
getMemberTransactionsCTI(memberId) ‚Üí Customer transaction history
getOrgTransactionsCTI(orgId) ‚Üí Administrative financial oversight

// Revenue Attribution Flow (Post Platform Fees)
Customer Payment ‚Üí Platform Fee Deduction ‚Üí Net Revenue ‚Üí 
Employee Attribution ‚Üí Job Profile Context ‚Üí Revenue Distribution ‚Üí
CTI Context Creation ‚Üí Multi-perspective Financial Access

// Authority & Budget Flow
Organization Budget ‚Üí Department Budget Authority ‚Üí Employee Spending Authority ‚Üí
Transaction Validation ‚Üí CTI Context Creation ‚Üí Audit Trail
```

### **Business Logic Validation Examples**
```javascript
// Revenue Attribution Validation
function validateProductAttribution(productId) {
  const attributions = getEmployeeAttributions(productId);
  const totalPercentage = attributions.reduce((sum, attr) => sum + attr.percentage, 0);
  return totalPercentage === 100; // Must sum to exactly 100%
}

// Budget Authority Validation  
function validateEmployeeExpense(employeeId, amount) {
  const department = getEmployeePrimaryDepartment(employeeId);
  const budgetAuthority = calculateInheritedBudgetAuthority(department);
  return amount <= budgetAuthority.remaining;
}

// CTI Context Creation
function createTransactionWithContexts(transactionData, contextConfig) {
  // 1. Create main transaction with business entity reference
  // 2. Create double-entry accounting lines
  // 3. Create appropriate CTI contexts based on business logic
  // 4. Ensure O(log n) query performance with proper indexing
}
```

This architecture transforms Volmify from a generic LMS to a professional creator economy platform with clear customer/creator separation, cross-organizational professional identity, sophisticated employee management capabilities with budget authority hierarchy, and marketplace-scale financial performance through the CTI system with proper indexing that aligns perfectly with your platform vision.

The system now properly handles the authority separation where employees have administrative capabilities while retaining member privileges for customer activities, enables post-platform-fee revenue attribution for accurate creator compensation, and provides a scalable foundation for marketplace features through job profile integration and cross-organizational professional reputation tracking.

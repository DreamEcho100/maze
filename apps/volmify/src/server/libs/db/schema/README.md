# **üìö Volmify Database Schema Overview - Updated**

## **üéì What Volmify Is**

## **üéØ Key Architectural Benefits**

### **1. Clean Business Logic Separation**
- **Members** handle customer activities (purchases, learning)
- **Employees** handle professional activities (creation, attribution)
- **Same user** can be both member AND employee in same org

### **2. Professional Context Integration**
- **Employees** optionally link to **job profiles** for professional identity
- **Cross-organizational reputation** through job profiles
- **Clear attribution path**: Product ‚Üí Employee ‚Üí Job Profile

### **3. Scalable Invitation Workflows**
- **Member invitations** for customer onboarding
- **Employee invitations** for staff recruitment with approval
- **Different permission flows** for different roles

### **4. Organizational Structure Clarity**
- **Department/Team membership** at employee level (work structure)
- **Learning groups/cohorts** at member level (community structure)
- **Clear separation** of professional vs. learning organization

## **üöÄ Migration from Current Schema**

### **Critical Changes Required**

#### **Revenue Attribution Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Generic member attribution
orgMemberProductAttribution ‚Üí orgEmployeeProductAttribution
orgMemberProductAttributionRevenue ‚Üí orgEmployeeProductAttributionRevenue

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-based professional attribution
// Links products to employees (who have job profiles)
// Clear separation: customers vs. creators
```

#### **Financial Operations Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Member-level financial operations
orgTaxRateSnapshot.byMemberId ‚Üí byEmployeeId
accountTransaction.postedByMemberId ‚Üí postedByEmployeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level professional operations
// Only staff should manage tax rates and post transactions
```

#### **Organizational Structure Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Generic member structure
orgDepartmentMembership.memberId ‚Üí orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership.employeeId
orgTeamMembership.memberId ‚Üí orgEmployeeTeamMembership.employeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level professional structure
// Departments and teams are work organization for staff
```

#### **Administrative Operations Migration**
```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Generic member operations
orgMemberInvitation.approvedByMemberId ‚Üí approvedByEmployeeId
orgProductRevenuePool.lastAllocationBy ‚Üí lastAllocationByEmployeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level administrative duties
// Only staff should approve invitations and manage revenue pools
```

### **Implementation Priority**
1. **Revenue Attribution** (Critical) - Fix core business logic
2. **Financial Operations** (Critical) - Ensure compliance
3. **Organizational Structure** (High) - Professional hierarchy
4. **Administrative Operations** (Medium) - Staff workflow clarity
5. **Invitation Systems** (Medium) - Proper onboarding separation

## **üéØ Developer Quick Start**

### **Understanding the Updated Architecture**
1. **Member vs Employee Distinction**: Members are customers/learners, employees are staff/creators
2. **Professional Attribution**: Revenue flows to employees (with job profiles), not generic members
3. **Organizational Structure**: Departments/teams for employees, learning groups for members
4. **Invitation Workflows**: Separate flows for customer onboarding vs staff recruitment
5. **Financial Operations**: Only employees handle tax management and accounting operations

### **Key Development Patterns**
```javascript
// Customer Activities (Member-level)
orgMemberOrder ‚Üí Customer purchases
orgMemberProductCourseEnrollment ‚Üí Learning participation
orgMemberLearningProfile ‚Üí Learning analytics

// Professional Activities (Employee-level)
orgEmployeeProductAttribution ‚Üí Content creation
orgEmployeeProductAttributionRevenue ‚Üí Creator compensation
orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership ‚Üí Work organization
orgEmployeeInvitation ‚Üí Staff recruitment

// Clear Attribution Flow
Customer (orgMember) ‚Üí Places Order ‚Üí Product Revenue ‚Üí 
Employee Attribution (orgEmployee) ‚Üí Job Profile Context ‚Üí Revenue Distribution
```

This architecture transforms Volmify from a generic LMS to a professional creator economy platform with clear customer/creator separation, cross-organizational professional identity, and sophisticated employee management capabilities that align perfectly with your marketplace vision.

# **üìö Volmify Database Schema Overview**

## **üéì What Volmify Is**

### **Primary Purpose**
Volmify is a comprehensive **creator economy platform** that combines learning management, e-commerce, and professional marketplace capabilities. It enables organizations to create, sell, and manage educational content while providing sophisticated employee management and revenue attribution systems.

### **Core Capabilities**
- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Course creation, enrollment, progress tracking
- **E-commerce Platform**: Product sales, subscriptions, gift cards, payment processing  
- **Creator Economy**: Revenue attribution, professional profiles, compensation management
- **Employee Management**: Staff onboarding, department organization, approval workflows
- **Professional Marketplace**: Cross-organizational job profiles, skill attribution, reputation systems
- **Advanced Financial System**: Double-entry accounting with multi-context CTI access for marketplace-scale performance

## **üèó Core Architecture Principles**

### **Multi-Tenant Foundation**
Every entity in Volmify is scoped to an organization (`orgId`), ensuring complete data isolation and supporting multiple independent tenants on the same platform.

### **User Identity Hierarchy**
```
User (platform identity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userProfile (main) - base customer profile  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userProfile (job) - professional profiles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userLocale - language preferences with proficiency levels

orgMember (tenant-scoped customer/learner)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orgEmployee (enhanced staff role with optional job profile link)
```

### **Role Separation**
- **Members**: Customers and learners who place orders, enroll in courses, participate in community
- **Employees**: Staff and creators who create content, receive revenue attribution, manage operations
- **Same user can be both**: Member (customer) AND employee (creator) within the same organization

### **Class Table Inheritance (CTI)**
Financial transactions use CTI for multi-context access, enabling O(1) performance for user transaction queries regardless of organizational complexity.

### **Multi-Context Access**
Single transactions are accessible through multiple entity contexts (user, employee, member, organization) with appropriate permission scoping.

## **üë§ User Management System**

```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Member-level financial operations
orgTaxRateSnapshot.byMemberId ‚Üí byEmployeeId
orgAccountingTransaction.postedByMemberId ‚Üí postedByEmployeeId

// ‚úÖ NEW: Employee-level professional operations
// Only staff should manage tax rates and post transactions
```

#### **CTI Financial System Migration**
```javascript
// NEW: Multi-context transaction access system
accountTransaction ‚Üí Enhanced with businessEntityType/businessEntityId
accountTransactionContext ‚Üí Base context metadata
accountTransactionUserContext ‚Üí Cross-org user access
accountTransactionEmployeeContext ‚Üí Professional creator access
accountTransactionMemberContext ‚Üí Customer purchase access

```

### **Implementation Priority**
1. **Revenue Attribution** (Critical) - Fix core business logic
2. **CTI Financial System** (Critical) - Enable marketplace-scale performance
3. **Financial Operations** (Critical) - Ensure compliance
4. **Organizational Structure** (High) - Professional hierarchy
5. **Administrative Operations** (Medium) - Staff workflow clarity

## **üéØ Developer Quick Start**

### **Understanding the Updated Architecture**
1. **Member vs Employee Distinction**: Members are customers/learners, employees are staff/creators
2. **Professional Attribution**: Revenue flows to employees (with job profiles), not generic members
3. **CTI Financial System**: Multi-context access with O(1) performance for any entity type
4. **Organizational Structure**: Departments/teams for employees, learning groups for members
5. **Invitation Workflows**: Separate flows for customer onboarding vs staff recruitment
6. **Financial Operations**: Only employees handle tax management and accounting operations

### **Key Development Patterns**

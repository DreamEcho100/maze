# **üìö Schema Documentation Design Guidelines**

## **üéØ Documentation Philosophy**

### **Core Principles**
- **Architecture Over Implementation**: Focus on design decisions, not code restatement
- **Business Context First**: Explain WHY before WHAT
- **Developer Acceleration**: Minimize time-to-understanding for new team members
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Avoid redundant explanations of self-evident code

### **Multi-Tenant Creator Platform Focus**
Given our multi-tenant educational content platform with creator economy, documentation should emphasize:
- **Organization-Centric Design**: How all features operate within organizational boundaries
- **Creator Economy Integration**: How brand and professional attribution systems work together
- **Professional Scalability**: How the architecture supports multiple profession types
- **Cross-Schema Integration**: How professional profiles interact across organizational contexts

## **üìÅ Documentation Structure**

### **Current Folder Pattern**
```
üìÇ schema-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # üéØ High-level overview and quick start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.js              # üíæ Database schema with JSDoc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relations.js           # üîó Relationships with JSDoc

- **Repetitive explanations**: Information available from code inspection
- **Low-level implementation**: Details that belong in code comments

### **JSDoc Focus Areas**
- **File level**: Architecture pattern and professional scalability
- **Table level**: Business purpose and professional workflow integration
- **Field level**: Only when business rules or professional attribution exists
- **Relationship level**: Cross-organizational collaboration and professional identity

## **üöÄ Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: Core Professional Architecture Documentation**
1. **User instructor profile schema**: Professional identity and multi-profile system
2. **Organization schema**: Multi-tenant boundaries and brand attribution
3. **Product attribution schemas**: Professional content creation workflows

### **Phase 2: Creator Economy Documentation**
1. **Revenue attribution**: How professionals earn from content
2. **Cross-organizational collaboration**: Instructor affiliation networks
3. **Brand attribution**: Organization brand identity and content attribution

### **Phase 3: Scalability Documentation**
1. **New profession patterns**: How to add consultants, designers, lawyers, etc.
2. **Performance optimization**: Query patterns for professional workflows
3. **Integration workflows**: API patterns for professional data

## **üìè Success Metrics**

### **Developer Onboarding**
- **Time to first meaningful contribution**: < 2 days
- **Professional workflow comprehension**: Understanding attribution flows within 1 day
- **Integration confidence**: Ability to add new profession types

### **Documentation Effectiveness**
- **Self-service capability**: Developers find answers without asking teammates
- **Consistency**: Similar professional patterns documented similarly
- **Maintenance burden**: Documentation updates are part of normal development flow

## **üéØ Key Reminder**

**JSDoc comments are meant to enhance the onboarding experience by helping developers understand the creator economy architecture, professional attribution systems, and multi-tenant organizational boundaries‚Äînot to overwhelm them with unnecessary details.**

**Always update existing files in-place, never create new files. Preserve all existing code structure, comments, and logic while adding JSDoc documentation to enhance architectural understanding.**

**Focus on accelerating developer understanding of professional workflows, creator economy systems, and multi-tenant organizational design, not restating what the code already expresses clearly.** üéØ

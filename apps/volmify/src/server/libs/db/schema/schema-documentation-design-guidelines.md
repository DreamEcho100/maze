# **📚 Schema Documentation Design Guidelines**

## **🎯 Documentation Philosophy**

### **Core Principles**
- **Architecture Over Implementation**: Focus on design decisions, not code restatement
- **Business Context First**: Explain WHY before WHAT, emphasizing creator economy and e-commerce workflows
- **Developer Acceleration**: Minimize time-to-understanding for new team members joining multi-tenant systems
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Avoid redundant explanations of self-evident code patterns

### **Multi-Tenant Creator Platform with Integrated E-commerce Focus**
Given our multi-tenant educational content platform with creator economy and sophisticated e-commerce, documentation should emphasize:
- **Organization-Centric Design**: How all features operate within organizational boundaries with brand attribution
- **Creator Economy Integration**: How professional attribution and revenue sharing systems work together
- **E-commerce Foundation**: How product variants, payment plans, and pricing strategies integrate
- **Job Scalability**: How the architecture supports multiple profession types and cross-organizational collaboration
- **Integrated Payment Architecture**: How payment plans eliminate pricing table redundancy while maintaining sophistication

## **🔄 Schema File Update Standards**

### **⚠️ Critical Requirements**
- **NEVER CREATE NEW FILES** - Always update existing schema and relations files in-place
- **PRESERVE EXISTING CODE** - Keep all existing code, imports, exports, and logic unchanged
- **JSDoc ENHANCEMENT ONLY** - Add JSDoc documentation without modifying any existing functionality
- **MAINTAIN STRUCTURE** - Preserve all existing code organization, spacing, and patterns

### **✅ JSDoc Enhancement Process**

#### **1. Add File-Level JSDoc** (if missing)
```javascript
/**
 * @fileoverview [Schema] - [Business Purpose with Creator Economy Context]
 * 
 * @architecture [Pattern] + [Integration Strategy]
 * [Architecture explanation focusing on creator economy and e-commerce integration]
 * 
 * @designPattern [Specific Patterns Used]
 * - [Pattern 1]: [How it enables creator economy features]
 * - [Pattern 2]: [How it supports e-commerce workflows]
 * - [Pattern 3]: [How it maintains organizational boundaries]
 * 
 * @integrationPoints
 * - [Integration 1]: [Creator economy workflow description]
 * - [Integration 2]: [E-commerce process description]
 * - [Integration 3]: [Cross-organizational collaboration description]
 * 
 * @businessValue
 * [Business value with focus on creator economy and e-commerce capabilities]
 * 
 * @scalingDesign
 * [How patterns support growth in creators, payment models, and organizations]
 */
```

#### **2. Add Table-Level JSDoc** (for all major tables)
```javascript
/**
 * [Business Purpose] - [Role in Creator Economy/E-commerce]
 * 
 * @businessLogic [Key business workflows and rules]
 * @organizationScope [Multi-tenant boundary handling]
 * @architecturalDecision [Why this design was chosen]
 * @integrationContext [Cross-system workflow enablement]
 * @scalabilityPattern [How this supports growth]
 */
export const tableName = table(/* existing definition unchanged */);
```

#### **3. Add Field-Level JSDoc** (selectively - only for complex business rules)
```javascript
// Only add field JSDoc when field has special business significance
/**
 * @businessRule [Important business constraint or logic]
 * @organizationScope [Multi-tenant relevance]
 * @professionalContext [Creator economy relevance]
 * @ecommerceContext [E-commerce workflow relevance]
 * @performanceCritical [High-frequency access pattern]
 */
fieldName: fieldDefinition,
```

#### **4. Add Enum JSDoc** (for all enums)
```javascript
/**
 * [Enum Purpose] - [Business Context]
 * 
 * @businessLogic [How values drive workflows]:
 * - [value]: [Business meaning and usage context]
 * [Continue for each enum value]
 */
export const enumName = pgEnum(/* existing definition unchanged */);
```

### **🚫 What NOT to Change**
- **Any existing code logic, structure, or formatting**
- **Import/export statements**
- **Table, field, or relationship definitions**
- **Index or constraint definitions**
- **Existing comments (inline or block)**
- **Variable names or types**

### **✅ What TO Add**
- **File-level JSDoc blocks** explaining architecture and business context
- **Table-level JSDoc blocks** explaining business purpose and integration
- **Selective field-level JSDoc** only for complex business rules or key workflows
- **Enum JSDoc blocks** explaining business meaning of values
- **Selective constraint/index JSDoc** only for complex business rules or critical performance

## **📋 Relations File Documentation**

### **File-Level JSDoc for Relations**
```javascript
/**
 * @fileoverview [Schema] Relations - [Integration Purpose]
 * 
 * @integrationPattern [Pattern Description]
 * [How relations enable creator economy workflows, e-commerce processes, and organizational collaboration]
 * 
 * @businessContext
 * [Business workflows enabled by these relations in creator economy and e-commerce context]
 * 
 * @scalabilityContext
 * [How relation patterns support multiple creator types and payment strategies]
 */
```

### **Relation-Level JSDoc** (selective)
```javascript
/**
 * [Entity] Relations ([Role in System])
 * 
 * @integrationRole [How this entity integrates with broader creator economy]
 * @businessRelationships [Key workflows enabled]
 * @scalabilityPattern [How this supports growth]
 */
export const entityRelations = relations(entity, ({ one, many }) => ({
    /**
     * @businessContext [Complex relationship significance]
     * @professionalWorkflow [Creator economy relevance]
     * @ecommerceWorkflow [E-commerce process relevance]
     * @organizationBoundary [Multi-tenant relationship handling]
     */
    relationName: one/many(/* existing definition unchanged */),
}));
```

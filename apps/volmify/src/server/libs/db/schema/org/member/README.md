# **üè¢ Organization Member & Employee Management System**

This README explains how the organization member and employee management system works and how it should be implemented in the dashboard and system interactions.

## **üéØ System Overview**

The member and employee management system provides a comprehensive organizational structure supporting:
- **Member lifecycle management** (invitation ‚Üí active ‚Üí suspended/left) for customers/learners
- **Employee management system** (invitation ‚Üí approval ‚Üí hiring ‚Üí active) for staff/creators
- **Hierarchical departments** with nested structures for employees
- **Flexible team collaboration** across departments for employees
- **Professional attribution** through job profile integration
- **Dual invitation workflows** for customers vs staff onboarding

## **üë• Core Entities & Their Purpose**

### **1. Organization Members (`orgMember`)**
**Purpose**: Customer/learner identity within an organization context

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-tenant user identity**: Same user can be member of multiple organizations
- **Customer role**: Primary focus on learning, purchasing, and community participation
- **Status lifecycle**: `invited` ‚Üí `active` ‚Üí `suspended`/`left`/`removed`
- **Display customization**: Custom display name per organization
- **Learning profile integration**: Connected to learning analytics and progress tracking

### **2. Organization Employees (`orgEmployee`)**
**Purpose**: Staff/creator identity with professional responsibilities and attribution

**Key Features**:
- **Professional upgrade**: Optional enhancement from member to employee status
- **Job profile integration**: Links to cross-organizational professional identity
- **Employment lifecycle**: `pending` ‚Üí `approved` ‚Üí `active` ‚Üí `terminated`
- **Revenue attribution**: Product creation and compensation tracking
- **Organizational duties**: Department/team assignments, administrative responsibilities
- **Compensation management**: Salary tracking separate from product attribution

### **3. Member Invitations (`orgMemberInvitation`)**
**Purpose**: Customer/learner onboarding workflow

**Key Features**:
- **Email-based invitations** for customer access
- **Learning-focused**: Course access grants and learning community participation
- **Community integration**: Study groups, learning cohorts, forum access
- **Simple approval**: Direct acceptance without complex approval workflows

### **4. Employee Invitations (`orgEmployeeInvitation`)**
**Purpose**: Staff recruitment and professional onboarding workflow

**Key Features**:
- **Professional recruitment**: Staff roles with job profile context
- **Approval workflow**: Administrative review and approval required
- **Employment details**: Proposed salary, start date, department assignment
- **Role specification**: Professional roles (instructor, admin, manager, creator)
- **Job profile linking**: Optional connection to professional identity

### **5. Departments (`orgDepartment`)**
**Purpose**: Professional organizational structure for employees

**Key Features**:
- **Employee-focused**: Work organization and reporting structure
- **Nested hierarchy**: Parent-child department relationships
- **Department types**: `department`, `division`, `business_unit`, `office`, `region`
- **Professional context**: Linked to job profiles and career development
- **Budget authority**: Financial responsibility and autonomy levels

### **6. Teams (`orgTeam`)**
**Purpose**: Employee collaboration units for project-based work

**Key Features**:
- **Cross-functional teams**: Employees from multiple departments
- **Project-based**: Temporary or permanent collaboration units
- **Team types**: `departmental`, `cross_functional`, `project`, `permanent`
- **Professional collaboration**: Work-focused team structure

### **7. Employee Department Memberships (`orgEmployeeDepartmentMembership`)**
**Purpose**: Employee assignment to departments with professional context

**Key Features**:
- **Professional assignment**: Work-based department structure
- **Job profile context**: Connected to professional identity
- **Career development**: Department-based professional growth

### **8. Employee Team Memberships (`orgEmployeeTeamMembership`)**
**Purpose**: Employee participation in teams with work roles

**Key Features**:
- **Team-scoped roles**: `admin` (team management) vs `member`
- **Professional collaboration**: Work-focused team participation
- **Project assignments**: Temporary or permanent team assignments

## **üîÑ Architecture Separation: Members vs Employees**

### **Member Activities (Customer/Learner Focus)**
```javascript

orgMemberGiftCardUsage                  // Customer benefits and rewards
orgMemberProductCourseChallengeRating   // Course feedback and ratings
```

### **Employee Activities (Professional/Work Focus)**
```javascript

# **💳 Financial System & Double-Entry Accounting Architecture**

This README explains the comprehensive financial system architecture that enables accurate revenue attribution, organizational financial management, and creator economy transparency within the Volmify platform.

## **🎯 System Overview**

The account domain provides **enterprise-grade financial management** supporting:
- **Double-entry accounting system** with chart of accounts for accurate financial tracking
- **Multi-currency financial operations** enabling international business and creator compensation
- **Employee-managed account structure** with administrative authority for financial configuration
- **Revenue attribution integration** tracking creator compensation and organizational earnings
- **Transaction lifecycle management** with complete audit trails and compliance support
- **Organizational financial boundaries** maintaining multi-tenant financial isolation
- **Automated financial calculations** for complex creator economy revenue flows

## **🏗️ Core Architecture Principles**

### **1. Double-Entry Accounting Foundation**
```
Double-Entry Accounting Rules:
Every Transaction Has Two Sides:
├── Debit Entry (increases assets/expenses, decreases liabilities/equity/revenue)
├── Credit Entry (increases liabilities/equity/revenue, decreases assets/expenses)
└── Total Debits = Total Credits (accounting equation balance)

Account Types & Normal Balances:
├── Assets (Debit Normal): Cash, receivables, equipment
├── Liabilities (Credit Normal): Payables, loans, deferred revenue
├── Equity (Credit Normal): Owner's equity, retained earnings
├── Revenue (Credit Normal): Sales, service revenue, creator earnings
└── Expenses (Debit Normal): Operating costs, platform fees, processing fees
```

### **2. Creator Economy Financial Integration**
```
Revenue Attribution Financial Flow:
Customer Payment: $100
├── Revenue Account (Credit): $100 total customer payment
├── Platform Fee Account (Debit): $5 platform revenue
├── Processing Fee Account (Debit): $3 payment processing cost
├── Tax Liability Account (Credit): $8 tax collection
├── Creator Compensation Account (Debit): $84 net creator payment
└── Cash Account (Debit): $100 cash received

  name: varchar("name", { length: 256 }).notNull(),
  description: varchar("description", { length: 1536 }).notNull(),
  type: accountTypeEnum("type").notNull(),
  normalBalance: balanceTypeEnum("normal_balance").notNull(),
  currentBalance: numeric("current_balance", { precision: 12, scale: 4 }).default("0.00"),
  currencyCode: currencyCodeFkCol().notNull(),
  isSystem: boolean("is_system").default(false),
  isActive: boolean("is_active").default(true),
  // ... audit fields

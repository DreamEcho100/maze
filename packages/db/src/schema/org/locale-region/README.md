## **🌐 Core Localization Entities & Business Purpose**

### **Organization Locales (`orgLocale`)**
**Business Purpose**: Organization-controlled language market configuration with content strategy and business prioritization

```javascript
export const orgLocale = table("org_locale", {
  id: textCols.idPk(),
  orgId: orgIdFkCol().notNull(), // Multi-tenant locale management
  localeKey: localeKeyFkCol().notNull(), // References platform-wide locale registry
  
  // Organizational language market control
  isDefault: boolean("is_default").default(false), // Primary business language
  isActive: boolean("is_active").default(true), // Market activation status
  
  // Content localization strategy
  contentStrategy: text("content_strategy"), // "full_translation", "partial", "auto_translate"
  
  // ... audit fields
});
```

**Organizational Language Market Configuration:**

#### **Default Language Management**
- **Single default locale**: Only one locale can be marked as default per organization
- **Primary business language**: Default locale determines primary business communication
- **Fallback content**: Default locale content used when specific locale content unavailable
- **Administrative interface**: Default locale determines employee interface language

#### **Content Strategy Types**
- **`full_translation`**: Complete content translation with native speaker review
  - Professional translation of all content and educational materials
  - Native speaker content review and cultural adaptation
  - Complete localized customer experience and support
  - Full SEO optimization for regional search engines

- **`partial`**: Strategic content translation for key markets
  - Priority content translation (product descriptions, key pages)
  - Automated translation for secondary content
  - Localized customer support for business hours
  - Basic SEO optimization for market entry

- **`auto_translate`**: Automated translation with minimal human oversight
  - AI-powered content translation for market testing
  - Basic cultural adaptation and content review
  - Automated customer support with escalation options
  - Standard SEO optimization with automated content generation

### **Organization Regions (`orgRegion`)**
**Business Purpose**: Geographic market segmentation with currency, tax, and business rule configuration

```javascript
export const orgRegion = table("org_region", {
  id: textCols.idPk(),
  orgId: orgIdFkCol().notNull(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 100 }).notNull(), // "North America", "European Union"
  description: text("description"),
  
  // Geographic and currency configuration
  countryCode: varchar("country_code", { length: 2 }).notNull(), // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
  currencyCode: currencyCodeFkCol().notNull(), // Regional currency for commerce
  
  // Regional business configuration
  isActive: boolean("is_active").default(true),
  isDefaultShipping: boolean("is_default_shipping").default(false),
  
  // ... audit fields
});
```

**Regional Market Business Applications:**

#### **Geographic Market Segmentation**
- **Business regions**: Geographic areas with distinct business rules and operations
- **Currency zones**: Regions sharing currency for pricing and payment processing
- **Tax jurisdictions**: Geographic areas with specific tax compliance requirements
- **Shipping regions**: Areas with coordinated shipping and fulfillment operations

#### **Regional Configuration Examples**
```javascript
// Regional market configuration patterns
"North America": {
  countryCodes: ["US", "CA", "MX"],
  currencyCode: "USD",
  businessRules: "NAFTA commerce regulations",
  taxCompliance: "Multi-jurisdictional sales tax"
}

"European Union": {
  countryCodes: ["DE", "FR", "ES", "IT", "NL"],
  currencyCode: "EUR", 
  businessRules: "EU commerce directives",
  taxCompliance: "VAT compliance across member states"
}

"Asia Pacific": {
  countryCodes: ["JP", "AU", "SG", "KR"],
  currencyCode: "USD", // Multi-currency with USD base
  businessRules: "APAC regional commerce standards",
  taxCompliance: "Country-specific tax handling"
}
```

### **Region Internationalization (`orgRegionI18n`)**
**Business Purpose**: Localized regional descriptions and SEO optimization for international market presence

```javascript
export const orgRegionI18n = table("org_region_i18n", {
  regionId: textCols.idFk("region_id").references(() => orgRegion.id).notNull(),
  localeKey: localeKeyFkCol().notNull(), // Localized content language
  
  // Localized regional content
  name: varchar("name", { length: 100 }).notNull(), // Localized region name
  description: text("description"), // Localized region description
  seoMetadataId: seoMetadataIdFkCol(), // Regional SEO optimization
  
  // ... audit fields
});
```

**International Regional Content Benefits:**
- **Localized region names**: Regional market names in local languages for customer clarity

/**
 * @file Contact Info Relations â€“ Polymorphic Integration Layer
 *
 * @context
 * This file defines how the universal `contactInfo` table connects to various platform entities
 * using polymorphic and junction-table-based relationships â€” enabling flexible, multi-entity
 * communication flows without tight foreign key coupling.
 *
 * @architecture
 * - ðŸ”„ Polymorphic Pattern: One contact table, many associated entities
 * - ðŸ§© Soft Relations: Avoids hard FKs in favor of decoupled, scalable linking
 * - ðŸ”Œ Integration-Ready: Allows new entity types to connect to contact info with minimal friction
 *
 * @useCases
 * - User profile contact management
 * - Future support for org, user, and brand-level contacts
 * - Dynamic communication routing, support escalation, and partner outreach
 *
 * @why
 * Traditional one-to-one contact models break down in multi-tenant, multi-role platforms like Volmify.
 * This polymorphic structure enables flexible contact ownership, communication orchestration, and
 * tailored contact strategies across all professional and org layers.

/**
 * Defines polymorphic contact associations for platform entities.

 * @relation contactInfoRelations
 * Allows user profiles (and in future, other entity types) to associate

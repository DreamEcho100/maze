## **Job Profile Integration Use Cases**

For your **hybrid LMS/LinkedIn/Discord** platform, job profiles could enable:

#### **Professional Discovery**
```javascript
// Use case: Org wants instructor for "Advanced React" course
// Job profile filtering:
userJobProfile.skills: ["React", "TypeScript", "Teaching"]
userJobProfile.experience: "Senior"
userJobProfile.rating: 4.5+

// Auto-suggest qualified professionals across ALL orgs
```

#### **Skill-Based Product Assignment**
```javascript
// Use case: New course needs creator
// Product requirements:
orgProduct.requiredSkills: ["Python", "Data Science"]
orgProduct.difficultyLevel: "Intermediate"

// Match against:
userJobProfile.skills + orgEmployeeProductAttribution.successRate
// Suggest best-fit employees for attribution
```

#### **Cross-Org Collaboration**
```javascript
// Use case: John (instructor at Org A) guest lectures at Org B
// Job profile enables:
orgEmployee (Org A) + userJobProfile â†’ temporary attribution at Org B
// Revenue flows to John's job profile, visible across both orgs
```
